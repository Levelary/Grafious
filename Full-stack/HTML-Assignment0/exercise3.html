  <br>
  <p style = "text-align: justify;">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, has a rich history that dates back to the early days of the World Wide Web. HTML was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in 1989 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was published in 1991 as a simple markup language for creating documents with hypertext links.</p>
  <br>
  <p style = "text-align: left;">As the web began to grow, the need for standardization became apparent. In 1995, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed the HTML Working Group to develop HTML standards. Since its release, HTML5 has become the standard for web development, and ongoing efforts continue to refine and extend its capabilities.</p>
